# cookiecutter-golang-cli

A template powered by [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) for building command-line interface in golang using the [cli](https://github.com/mitchellh/cli) framework. If you know me professionally - you know I love writing scripts/cli/programs to automate my development and operational workflow. I find myself copying a bunch of stuff from different projects - so this template reflects the typical cli project I would create. Buyer Beware - alot of the choice I make in this project is personal preference!

See [this repo](https://github.com/jamescurtin/demo-cookiecutter-flask) for an example project generated from the most recent version of the template.

## Use it now

If you don't have cookiecutter installed and Python â‰¥ 3.6 is required. you'll need to install that first using Python's pip command:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

alternatively you can install cookiecutter via brew

```bash
$ brew intall cookiecutter
```

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/srizzling/cookiecutter-golang-cli.git
```

You will be asked about your basic info (name, project name, app name, etc.). This info will be used in your new project.
